# check_tbx_entries
A script project to check a TBX-file for specific entries in the term-tag

This is a training project, where I use chatGPT to create the scripts and then tweak them to my desire.

A common problem in Terminology-Databases and company taxonomies are homographs. The same sequence of letters mean different things in different context. Therefor terminology checker in translation often encounter the problem that not the correct "concept"(German: "Begriff") are concerned and therefor you receive a lot of false-positives.

Together with a list of homographs that are common in certain domains and languages you can use this scrip to identify missing homographs in your terminology repository.
